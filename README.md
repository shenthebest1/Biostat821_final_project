## Project Name: Stroke Prediction
We are going to create an application which could predict the stroke of patients, giving their gender, age, hypertension and so on. 
## Architecture
We are going to use SQLites database to store the data, which cited from Kaggle, and use the data to train sklearning models and predict the stroke status of patients. The whole process includes data visualization, model selection, and user interface. We still haven't decided which method to build user interface.
